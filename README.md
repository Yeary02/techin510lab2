## Lessons Learned

In the process of building this web app, I learned several valuable lessons:

- Streamlit provides a simple and efficient way to create interactive web applications with Python, particularly for data analysis and visualization tasks.
- Seaborn and Matplotlib libraries offer powerful tools for creating various types of data visualizations, which can be seamlessly integrated into Streamlit apps.

## Questions/Uncertainties

While developing this web app, there are some questions and uncertainties:

- How can we optimize the performance of the app, especially when dealing with large datasets or complex visualizations? Are there any strategies or techniques we can employ to reduce load times and improve responsiveness?
- Are there any best practices or security measures we should implement to safeguard sensitive information and protect against potential threats?
